an experiment in betting via the football channel on warpcast. 

## Data

raw files come from:

- [gist](https://gist.github.com/joshuamiller/f64969760aad0e1365e76867f1295ac4) for who bet from the prediction frame
- [erc20 token transfers](https://basescan.org/exportData?type=addresstokentxns&a=0x917cD75e2009E6193eEc3b23Cc89cF0cd59a28Ed) for the football party
- [eth token transfers](https://basescan.org/address/0x917cD75e2009E6193eEc3b23Cc89cF0cd59a28Ed) for the football party (not used so far)

## Usage

Just look at the notebook. ideally, we also know the predictions from the frame itself.
